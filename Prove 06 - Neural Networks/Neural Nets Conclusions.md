# Neural Nets Conclusions
1. **Please submit a link to your GitHub repository for your class**
https://github.com/exaudeus/Machine-Learning-and-Visualization
2. **Describe your overall approach to implementing the algorithm in code. How are your classes/data structures organized? How do you keep track of the necessary pieces for back-propagation.**
Basically, we have a NeuralNet class that has a list of Layers (also a class), each layer has a list of Nodes (also a class). Each node contains the weights to its left, the activation value, and the error.
3. **Describe the part of the assignment that gave you the most trouble, and how you overcame it.**
4. **Produce at least one graph to show the training progress for the Iris dataset.**
5. **Compare your results on the Iris dataset to those of an existing implementation.**
Existing implementation: 65%
Our implementation: 94.3%
6. **Produce at least one graph to show the training progress for the Diabetes dataset.**
7. **Compare your results on the Diabetes dataset to those of an existing implementation.**
Existing implementation: 63%
Our implementation: 66%
8. **Describe any efforts you made to go above and beyond.**
Car existing: 69%
Car our implementation: 86.2%
9. **Please state which category you feel best describes your assignment and give a 1-2 sentence justification for your choice: A) Some attempt was made, B) Developing, but significantly deficient, C) Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate, D) Meets requirements, E) Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements.**
