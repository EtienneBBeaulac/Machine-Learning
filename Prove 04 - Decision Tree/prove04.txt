When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please provide a link to your classifier in your public GitHub repo.
https://github.com/exaudeus/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Prove%2004%20-%20Decision%20Tree

2. Briefly describe your overall approach to the task and highlight the most difficult part of this assignment.
We started by building the get info gain function, after which we worked on the creation of the tree, which was quite a challenge since it was using recursion. Once we understood all the different rules, we were able to finish it.

3. Describe the dataset that you used.
We used the voting dataset and the Iris dataset

4. Describe your results on this dataset. (e.g., What was the size of the tree? How did your implementation compare to existing implementations? How did your decision tree compare to your kNN classifier)
The size of the tree for the voting dataset was about 4-5 deep because of the number of features. It was about as accurate as existing classifiers, and more accurate than KNN.
The size of the tree for iris was anywhere from 1-3 usually. It was also about as accurate as existing classifiers, and it was about as accurate as our KNN.

5. Include a textual representation of the tree your algorithm produced for the iris dataset.
We used ranges to categorize it.
{'petal length (cm)': {'(0.994, 2.967]': 0,
                       '(2.967, 4.933]': {'petal width (cm)': {'(0.0976, 0.9]': 1,
                                                               '(0.9, 1.7]': 1,
                                                               '(1.7, 2.5]': 2}},
                       '(4.933, 6.9]': 2}}

This tree was about 96% accurate.

6. If applicable, please describe anything you did to go above and beyond and the results you saw.
We used more than one dataset, we implemented it into our shell, we made it work even if the training data did not have all the values in its subsets, we made it pretty robust, and very accurate

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements   <---

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I think we went above and beyond because we kept working on improvements once we had finished it (which was last week, so we had a whole other week to work on it). We were curious to see the results with other datasets.
